# Hello Next

This is my first post on my new hand crafted blog!

I'm going to keep this one short. Up until the time of this writing my site (and the one you are probably on)
has been using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). If you're a react developer and unfamiliar with Gatsby you should really know about it.
It's pretty awesome. Gatsby has served me well with its excellent dev tools and community for years but now I'm making
some changes to the site that will give it some cool new features for federation!

Over the past year or so I've been interested in the [Indie Web](https://indieweb.org/) and
[ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/). I see it as a brave new internet that I would like to be a part of and help
build. So in order to have some extra server-side features I have moved this site over to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

I've been a big fan of Zeit since Next.js v1 but have never really delve into the framework so I'm really excited
to be finally getting my hands dirty with it.
